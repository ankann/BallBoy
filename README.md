# BallBoy
The project simulates the trajectory of a table-tennis ball,, taking into account the angular velocity, linear acceleration and linear velocity taken from the ABB Robot Hand Manipulator data and estimated from Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow. The dynamics of the ball is influenced by the friction of the ground which changes the state of the ball when the ball hits. Moreover when the ball gets hit the other side i.e. by the batsman, estimating the 6 dimensional impulse and 3 dimensional force given by the batsman to that ball, one can iterate the following trajectory after being hit.
